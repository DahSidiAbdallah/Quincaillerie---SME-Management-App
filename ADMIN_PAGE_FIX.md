# Admin Page Diagnostics and Fix

This script analyzes the admin page functionality and provides a diagnostic tool to fix issues with displaying users and saving settings.

## Problem Description

The admin page is experiencing the following issues:
1. Not showing the list of users
2. Settings (param√®tres) not being saved
3. Other tabs like sauvegarde, journaux, and system not working properly

## Root Causes

After analyzing the code, we identified these issues:

1. **API Communication Issues**: There might be authentication or request format problems
2. **Data Loading**: The user data might not be properly loaded into Alpine.js state
3. **Error Handling**: Poor error feedback when operations fail

## Solution

We've implemented several fixes:

1. Added a diagnostic script (`admin-diagnostics.js`) that:
   - Tests all admin API endpoints
   - Verifies authentication
   - Checks if data is properly loaded into Alpine.js
   - Can directly update Alpine.js data

2. Enhanced error logging in the admin.html template:
   - Added console logging for all API calls
   - Improved error messages and user feedback

3. Improved the common.js file:
   - Added a robust apiFetch function for authenticated API calls
   - Better error handling for API requests

## Using the Diagnostic Tool

The diagnostic tool will automatically run when the admin page is loaded. It creates a small window in the bottom-right corner showing:

- Authentication status
- Users list retrieval status
- Settings retrieval status
- Backups retrieval status
- Alpine.js data access status

If issues are detected, the tool will try to fix them by directly updating the Alpine.js data.

## Additional Recommendations

1. Check that you're logged in as an admin user
2. Verify database permissions are correct
3. Make sure the API endpoints are working by checking the diagnostic results
4. If specific settings aren't saving, check their format in the console log

## Implementation Details

- Added admin-diagnostics.js to detect and fix issues
- Enhanced error reporting in the admin page
- Improved apiFetch function in common.js to handle authentication properly
- Added detailed console logging for debugging
