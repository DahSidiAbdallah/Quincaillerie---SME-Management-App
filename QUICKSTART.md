# 🚀 Quick Start Instructions

## The Problem
You encountered compatibility issues with Python 3.13 and pandas installation. This is common with very new Python versions.

## ✅ Solution: Use the Quick Setup

I've created a simplified setup that works with Python 3.13:

### Step 1: Run Quick Setup
```powershell
python setup_quick.py
```

This will:
- Install only essential Flask dependencies
- Create a basic SQLite database
- Create a minimal working app

### Step 2: Start the Minimal App
```powershell
cd app
python app_minimal.py
```

### Step 3: Open in Browser
```
http://localhost:5000
```

**Login:** admin / PIN: 1234

## 🔧 What You Get

The minimal version includes:
- ✅ Working Flask web server
- ✅ SQLite database
- ✅ User authentication
- ✅ Basic dashboard
- ✅ Foundation for full features

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional)

Once the minimal version works, you can gradually add more features:

### 1. Install Additional Dependencies (when ready)
```powershell
# Try these individually if needed
pip install pandas>=2.2.0
pip install numpy>=1.26.0
pip install scikit-learn>=1.4.0
pip install openpyxl>=3.1.0
```

### 2. Create Missing Modules
The full app expects these modules (we created them earlier):
- `db/database.py` - Full database management
- `api/` folder - API endpoints
- `models/` folder - AI models
- `templates/` folder - HTML templates

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you still get errors:

### Option A: Use Even Simpler Dependencies
```powershell
pip install Flask
pip install python-dotenv
```

### Option B: Use Python 3.11 or 3.12
Pandas and other scientific packages work better with slightly older Python versions.

### Option C: Use Virtual Environment
```powershell
python -m venv quincaillerie_env
quincaillerie_env\Scripts\activate
pip install Flask python-dotenv
```

## 📞 What to Try First

1. **Run:** `python setup_quick.py`
2. **If it works:** Go to Step 2 above
3. **If it fails:** Try Option A in troubleshooting
4. **Report back:** Let me know what happens!

The goal is to get you a working Flask app first, then we can add features gradually. 🎉
